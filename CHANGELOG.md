# Changelog

## v1.7

- Added `installer.sh` for LinuxSat Panel and one-line installation (OE and DreamOS, `/usr/lib` and `/usr/lib64`).
- Fixed: untitled spacer markers inside an adult section no longer end the section early, leaving its remaining channels in place.
- Fixed: numbered and hidden markers (for example `1:320`) are now recognised as section headers.
- Fixed: Clean re-detects sections on the current file content instead of reusing line numbers from an earlier scan.
- Fixed: bouquet files are rewritten byte-for-byte (CRLF line endings and non-UTF-8 names are preserved).
- Fixed: Restore of a backup taken before Strict Kids Mode now un-hides the services again and reloads the parental-control lists.
- Fixed: Latin rule terms must start a word, so names such as "Sussex TV" or "Illustrated" are no longer removed by mistake.
- Fixed: Python 2 text normalisation for non-ASCII channel and category names.
- Fixed: the status text is shown before long scans and cleaning start.
- Fixed: skin images are loaded from the actual plugin path (works on `/usr/lib64` images).
- Added the missing `plugin.png`, `logo.png` and `main_bg.png` graphics.
- Removed unused imports (`getPrevAsciiCode` is missing on some images).
- Added IPK `postrm` script.
